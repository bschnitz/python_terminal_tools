### Python Terminal Tools (ptt)

#### DESCRIPTION

This folder contains the contents of the 'Python Terminal Tools' python package
and must be named ptt; otherwise python will not find the module references in
the source files. This seperation is done for other projects to be able to
include ptt as a submodule. The master branch of this project is an example,
since it has this branch as a submodul.
